description: "About me - Shubham Pharande. An engineer dabbling in computers, living the minimalist life"
---

Hello there! I am Shubham, an electrical engineer who loves machines and minimalism. I am fascinated by computers, right from the electrons flowing down in the circuitry, up to the complex ML models/$fad_of_the_day running way up, on top of the stack.

Starting off from embedded and microcomputing, I moved to enterprise software development. Nowadays, I take a keen interest in cybersecurity, specifically threat hunting, cyber defence and blue team practices. I research web malware at Georgia Tech's [Cyber Forensics Innovation Lab](https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu/). I am currently a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, aiming to graduate in the Spring of 2024.

When I am not tinkering, you can find me skimming through Hacker News or my RSS feed, learning español *con Duolingo*, geeking about Formula 1 or aviation or die-cast cars, reading or listening to a detective story, hiking/exploring nature, or stargazing if it is a clear starry night.

I am a keen proponent of privacy on the internet and the open web, and would love to contribute to these areas.
